# NodeRedCSS
Node Red Global CSS file in the form of UI template file with formatted text version for preview and a screenshot

This UI template sets up global styling for the rest of the NR app.  I hate material design, and prefer to go at it rouge and just make stuff I like.  I do not expect anyone to like what I did, but it shows how to style your own projects

This ui template file will be require for all the other NR flows I commit to Git.

Start here!

Disclaimer:

I have not fully "sanitized" any of these files.  Names, naming convention, formatting are all for my own use and do not adhere to any best practises or standard.

These file are for my own archiving purpose and being made available to anyone that wants to see a starter project for their own purpose. (Except usernames and passwords)

You can use these files for any private purpose you want.  No permission is given for commercial use.

If you find problems, do not expect me to implement fixes or maintain branches or multiple releases.  Feel free to modify the code as you see fit.  If you find something really egregious I would be interested in hearing about it even if I do nothing to fix it.  Call it a professional courtesy to simply share it back to me.
